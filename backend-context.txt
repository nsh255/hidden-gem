# Backend Context

## Overview
The backend is a server-side application designed to handle business logic, data processing, and communication with the database. It exposes APIs (REST or GraphQL) that the frontend or other services can consume.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: [Specify the language, e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.]
- **Framework**: [Specify the framework, e.g., Express.js, Django, etc.]
- **Database**: [Specify the database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.]
- **Authentication**: [Specify the method, e.g., JWT, OAuth, etc.]
- **Other Tools**: [Mention any additional tools or libraries used.]

## Key Features
- Handles user authentication and authorization.
- Manages CRUD operations for [specific resources].
- Implements business logic for [specific functionality].
- Provides APIs for frontend and third-party integrations.

## Docker Integration
The backend is containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across environments and simplify deployment.

### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile defines the steps to build a Docker image for the backend. It typically includes:
1. A base image (e.g., `node:alpine` for Node.js).
2. Copying the application code into the container.
3. Installing dependencies.
4. Exposing the necessary ports.
5. Defining the command to run the application.

### Docker Compose
If multiple services are involved (e.g., backend, database), Docker Compose is used to orchestrate them. The `docker-compose.yml` file specifies:
- The backend service configuration.
- Links to other services like the database.
- Environment variables for configuration.

## Deployment
The Docker image can be deployed to any container orchestration platform, such as Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or Docker Swarm. This ensures scalability and reliability in production environments.

## Notes
- Ensure the `.env` file is properly configured for environment-specific variables.
- Use volume mounts during development for live code updates.
- Follow best practices for securing the Docker image (e.g., multi-stage builds, minimizing layers).
